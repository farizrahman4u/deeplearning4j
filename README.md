[Eclipse Deeplearning4j](https://www.deeplearning4j.org/)  is the first commercial-grade, open-source, distributed deep-learning library written for Java and Scala. Integrated with Hadoop and Apache Spark, DL4J brings AI to business environments for use on distributed GPUs and CPUs.


---

## Features

* DL4J takes advantage of the latest distributed computing frameworks including Apache Spark and Hadoop to accelerate training. On multi-GPUs, it is equal to Caffe in performance.

* The libraries are completely open-source, Apache 2.0, and maintained by the developer community and Skymind team.

* Deeplearning4j is written in Java and is compatible with any JVM language, such as Scala, Clojure or Kotlin. The underlying computations are written in C, C++ and Cuda. Keras will serve as the Python API.


## Get started with Deeplearning4j


Hyperparameters are variables that determine how a neural network learns. They include how many times to update the weights of the model, how to initialize those weights, which activation function to attach to the nodes, which optimization algorithm to use, and how fast the model should learn. This is what one configuration would look like:

```java
    MultiLayerConfiguration conf = new NeuralNetConfiguration.Builder()
        .weightInit(WeightInit.XAVIER)
        .activation("relu")
        .optimizationAlgo(OptimizationAlgorithm.STOCHASTIC_GRADIENT_DESCENT)
        .updater(new Sgd(0.05))
        // ... other hyperparameters
        .list()
        .backprop(true)
        .build();
```
With Deeplearning4j, you add a layer by calling layer on the NeuralNetConfiguration.Builder(), specifying its place in the order of layers (the zero-indexed layer below is the input layer), the number of input and output nodes, nIn and nOut, as well as the type: DenseLayer.

```java
.layer(0, new DenseLayer.Builder().nIn(784).nOut(250)
.build())
```

Once you have configured your net, you can train the model with `model.fit`.
